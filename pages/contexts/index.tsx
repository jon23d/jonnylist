      <h1>Contexts</h1>
      <p>
        Contexts represent a location where you want to perform tasks, such as 'home, 'work', or
        'grocery store'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contexts are used to group tasks that are relevant to a specific location. For example, you
        might have a list of tasks to do at home, another list for work, and another list for the
        grocery store.
      </p>
